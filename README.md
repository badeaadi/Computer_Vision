# Mosaics
Created a mosaic of a photo from a dataset of different small photos (28 x 40).
The euclidean distance of spectrums of colors and different ratio aspect of the original photo were taken into consideration.

## Creation
More than one dataset of small images were used. For the most photos, the flower dataset was used.
There were five methods though which photos were created.

### Matrix, based on euclidean distance 


### Matrix, based on euclidean distance with every two photos different.


### Random positions, based on euclidean distance


### Hexagonal matrix



### Hexagonal matrix with every two adjacent hexagons different
